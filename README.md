Fantastic! Starting your DevOps pipeline journey is an exciting step towards streamlining your development process. Here's a breakdown of what you can focus on each day:

### Day 1: Getting Started with DevOps

**Goals:**
- **Understand DevOps Principles:** Familiarize yourself with the core principles of DevOps, emphasizing collaboration, automation, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD).
  
- **Setup Tools:** Install necessary tools like Docker for containerization and version control system (e.g., Git).

- **Explore CI/CD Platforms:** Research CI/CD platforms like GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, or GitHub Actions to determine which one aligns best with your project.

- **Project Planning:** Define the scope, objectives, and technologies for your DevOps project. Choose a sample application (e.g., a simple web app) for practice.

### Day 2: Containerization with Docker

**Goals:**
- **Docker Basics:** Familiarize yourself with Docker commands and concepts. Learn how to build, run, and manage containers.

- **Dockerfile Creation:** Write a Dockerfile to create an image for your chosen technology stack.

- **Container Networking:** Understand how Docker containers can communicate with each other and the outside world.

### Day 3: Setting Up a Git Repository

**Goals:**
- **Git Essentials:** Learn the basics of Git version control, including creating repositories, committing changes, and branching.

- **Create a Git Repository:** Initialize a Git repository for your sample application.

- **Commit Initial Code:** Add your sample application code and create an initial commit.

### Day 4: Automated Testing

**Goals:**
- **Select Testing Tools:** Choose testing frameworks (e.g., PHPUnit for PHP, Jest for JavaScript) suitable for your project.

- **Write Test Cases:** Begin writing automated tests for your sample application. Focus on basic functionality.

### Day 5: Setting Up CI/CD Pipeline

**Goals:**
- **Choose CI/CD Platform:** Decide on a CI/CD platform (e.g., GitLab CI/CD) and set up an account.

- **Configure CI/CD Pipeline:** Write a basic `.gitlab-ci.yml` (or equivalent) file to define your CI/CD pipeline stages, including building, testing, and deploying.

### Day 6: Integration with Minikube and Kubernetes

**Goals:**
- **Install Minikube:** Set up Minikube on your local environment for managing Kubernetes clusters.

- **Kubernetes Basics:** Learn the fundamentals of Kubernetes, including deployments, pods, services, and how they work together.

- **Write Kubernetes Deployment Files:** Create YAML files to define your sample application's deployment on Kubernetes.

### Day 7: Testing and Deployment

**Goals:**
- **Run Tests in CI/CD Pipeline:** Integrate automated tests into your CI/CD pipeline. Ensure that your tests are executed on every code commit.

- **Deploy to Minikube:** Apply your Kubernetes deployment files to deploy your sample application on the Minikube cluster.

By following this plan, you'll have a solid foundation in DevOps principles and practical experience with setting up a CI/CD pipeline in just one week. Remember to document your progress and take notes for reference. Good luck, and enjoy your DevOps journey!
